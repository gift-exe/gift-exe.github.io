I  ...  am a complex (yeah that's right!!), sometimes overly ambitious, and an enthusiastic fellow who's always had a passion for this dark art called "computer science" (you cannot convince me, this, "science" we speak of is not magic and sorcery)

A field of computer science I am (I and every other comp sci undergrad) interested in is Artificial Intelligence and it's definitely not because I watched too many sci-fi movies while I was younger lol ðŸ‘€.  
I believe, this is what the future is about...  
AI being fully integrated into our everyday lives and into humanity as a race.  

I still have a lot to say ðŸ™‚ but I'm too lazy to type all of it... So for now, I'll try to become less confused and build some ML models while I'm at it (hehe).  

Anyway, try not to take anything I say personally, 'cause I am "probably" joking (ðŸ‘€)
And remember, stay in school kids and eat your vegetables lol  

Do have a good day my good sir / dear lady / immaculate non-binary folk :)
