I  ...  am a complex (yeah that's right!!), sometimes overly ambitious, and an enthusiastic fellow who's always had a passion for this dark art called "computer science" (you cannot convince me, this, "science" we speak of is not magic and sorcery)

A field of computer science I (and every other comp sci undergrad) is interested in is Artificial Intelligence and it's definitely not because I've too many sci-fi movies about AI lol ðŸ‘€.  
    
I believe, this is what the future is about...  
AI being fully integrated into our everyday lives and into humanity as a race.  

I still have a lot to say but I'm toooo tired to type all of it... For now I plan on making like 68 ultra-gajillion-billion dollars, and build some ML models while I'm at it (hehe).  

Anyways, remember to stay in school kids and eat your vegetables lol  

Do have a good day my good sir / dear lady :)
