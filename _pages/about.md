I'm just a simple, sometimes overly ambitious, and enthusiastic guy that alwayed had a passion for all
things concerning software and computers in general.

My favourite part of this field (computer science) has to be Artificial Intelligence (Machine learning,
Deep learning etc.) and I think it's because I watched too much sci-fi movies while I was youngerðŸ˜„ðŸ‘€ (don't blame me it's not 
entirely my fault), and also because of the fact that -- to a large extent -- I believe that is what the future is about...
AI being fully integrated in our everyday lives and in human society as a whole.

Well I think one Big dream I have is to be a part of a team that works steadily and restlessly towards this 
future (AI in human society). If this was 20-30 years ago, It would've seem like a fantasy. But now 
it can easily be perceived as a possible reality. This is possible because of a lot of work that have been done
by Giants before us, and to me, it would be a real honour to be a part of this dream that is much bigger than us.

I still have a lot to say ðŸ™‚ but one can only say so much at a time... There will be more intresting stuffs in the 
blog section but for now, all i can say is; "you should to have a wonderful time". Just as Dr Karoly Zsolnai-Feher 
(from one of my favourite youtube channels) would say; "What a time to be alive !!" âœ¨
