I  ..  am a complex (yeah that's right!!), sometimes overly ambitious, and an (almost) enthusiastic guy who's always had a passion for this dark art called "computer science" (you cannot convince me, this is not magic and sorcery 😂)

A really cool part of this field that I'm interested in is Artificial Intelligence (of course it is lol) and it's definitely not because I watched too many sci-fi movies while I was younger😄👀.  
Y'know, to a large extent, this is what the future is about...  
(which is) AI being fully integrated into our everyday lives and into humanity as a race.  

Right now I'm trying to understand what exactly is going on in this field. Hopefully, everyone is as confused as me too (jk -- it's a joke it'll be bad if no one knew what they were doing 👀)  

I still have a lot to say 🙂 but I'm too lazy to type all of it... So for now, I'll try to become less confused and build some RL models while I'm at it (hehe).  

Anyway, try not to take anything I say too personally, 'cause I'm mostly joking (or am I? 👀)  
And remember stay in school and eat your vegetables 😁  
And if you're done with school ...  
umm, I don't think I am in a position to give you advice ...  
Since I'm still in school ...   
But do have a good one my good sir / dear lady / immaculate non-binary folks :)
