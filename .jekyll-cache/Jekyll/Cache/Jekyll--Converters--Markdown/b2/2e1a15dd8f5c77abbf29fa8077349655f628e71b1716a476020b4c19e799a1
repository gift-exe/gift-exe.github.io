I"É<p>I just a simple, sometimes overly ambitious, and enthusiastic guy that alwayed had a passion for all
things concerning software and computers in general. Presently in third year of Uni studying Computer Science
at Airforce Institute of Technology Kaduna.</p>

<p>My favourite part of this feild (computer science) has to be Artificial Intelligence (Machine learning,
Deep learning etc.) and I think itâ€™s because of too much sci-fi movies ğŸ˜„ğŸ‘€ (donâ€™t blame me itâ€™s not 
entirely my fault), and also because of the fact that, to a large extent, I believe that is what the future is aboutâ€¦
AI being fully integrated in our everyday lives and in human society as a whole.</p>

<p>Well I think one Big dream I have is to be a part of a team that works steadily and restlessly towards this 
future (AI in human society). If this was 20-30 years ago, It wouldâ€™ve seem like a far fetched dream. But now 
it can easily be perceived as a possible reality. This is possible because of a lot of work that have been done
by Giants before us, and to me, it would be a real honour to be a part of this dream that is much bigger than us.</p>

<p>I still have a lot to say ğŸ™‚ but one can only say so much at a timeâ€¦ There will be more intresting stuffs in the 
blog section but for now, all i can say is; â€œyou should to have a wonderful timeâ€. Just as Dr Karoly Zsolnai-Feher 
(from one of my favourite youtube channels) would say; â€œWhat a time to be alive !!â€ âœ¨</p>
