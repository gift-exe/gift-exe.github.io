I"Ì<p><strong>Hello world !!</strong>
Heyyy ğŸ‘‹ğŸ¿, soo this is my first blogâ€¦ Iâ€™m still not sure what exactly Iâ€™m doing right now it just seem like a fun thing to do
Iâ€™ve said some things about myself in the â€œabout meâ€ page, like how I am a fan of computer softwares and AIs and stuffs (..Iâ€™m mean who isnâ€™t? ğŸ˜…)
â€¦
I still donâ€™t know what exactly Iâ€™m going to be posting and how regular I plan to be, but I definately will put emotion in this and Iâ€™ll be (in most cases..) talking about Software tech, Science (mostly physics) and Iâ€™ll also share some coding projects that I carry out in my free time since Iâ€™ve got school I need to focus on. and Iâ€™ll also really appreciate your suggestions and ideas, and if your want you can also share your peoject ideas with me. Just send me an email using the contact me box/page (Iâ€™d really love to hear from you guys ğŸ˜Œ)
â€¦
Aiit thatâ€™s all for now 
Lemme go and look for food to eat ğŸ˜‹</p>
